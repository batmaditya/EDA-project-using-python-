🧪 Methodology
📍 Dataset
We use a dataset of real-time job postings (e.g., from Kaggle or a live scraping source), focusing on United States-based Data Analyst roles.

📌 Analysis 1: Most Demanded Skills for Top 3 Roles
Clean the skills column to standardize formats.

Group and count occurrences by job_title_short.

Calculate skill frequencies as a percentage.

Visualize skill distributions with bar charts.

📌 Analysis 2: Skill Trends for Data Analysts
Aggregate skill counts by month.

Normalize counts as a percentage of total jobs per month.

Plot monthly skill demand trends using line charts.

📌 Analysis 3: Skill Impact on Salary
Match skill mentions with average salary brackets.

Analyze which skills correlate with higher-paying Data Analyst roles.

Identify "optimal" skills — those that are high-paying and high-demand.
